# portfolio-project

This project is to try and implement the skills I have learned through _nology.

I have used html, scss that compiles into css. I have also tried to implement a bootstrap grid and a BEM naming method.
There are interactive elements, both text and image, using links that take you around the page and also to outside pages, these should open up separately to the main page.
There should be a recurring theme throughout the page, which uses scss variables that will make changing themes in the future easier.

I have attempted to break up my scss code into separate files of _base, _layout and _componenets to create a file structure that should be easier to find elements and read.

My project has one responsive element as the picture links to the outer fake projects shrink if the page gets too small. This should keep all of the elements easily seen even on a smaller screen.
